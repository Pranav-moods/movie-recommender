# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project is a basic **content-based movie recommendation system** built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It suggests similar movies based on the text description ("overview") of a given movie using **cosine similarity**.

##  Features

- Recommends movies similar to the one you input
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** on movie overviews
- Computes similarity using **cosine similarity**
- Simple and easy to understand implementation

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- Numpy

##  Dataset

The dataset used is provided, make sure to place them in same directory.

> Only the `title` and `overview` columns were used for this basic recommender.

##  How to Use

1. Clone this repository or open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Make sure to place the datasets in the same directory.
3. Run the notebook step-by-step.
